## Process:
**1.  Create Basic Template For ALL Webpages**

The Navbar and Footers were both defined features of BootStrap.

These two assets will remain constant between the 3 HTML files.
In addition to these, all three files will also implement a card.

*Examples of nonsemantic tags:*
```bash
<div class="header">

<div class="search-engine-optimization">
...
```
*Examples of semantic tag fixes:*
```bash
<header>

<section class="search-engine-optimization">
...
```
